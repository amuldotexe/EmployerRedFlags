# Objective
Creating this repo to document all the red flags which can help you avoid wrong employers

1. A employement contract which asks you to pay an amount in case you are not able to join the company after accepting the offer before employement commencement. For e.g. I received this screenshot in a closed group. Ideally if you see this clause, run in the other direction. This is basically a company who does not understand that an organization is significantly more powerful than an individual and thus does not mind intimidating you with a financial penalty. Trust me you'll find better options than this.
